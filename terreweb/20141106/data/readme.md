[Vancouver Crime Data](http://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/crime-data.htm)
 
 + The crime2013 folder includes 3 subfolders:
 	+ **raw**: includes the raw csv data from source link
 	+ **csv**: includes a derived dataset of the crime data. The included addresses of the crimes were fixed such that they could be geocoded using the [geocoder script](../scripts/geocoder/geocoder.py) - note: not all features were correctly geocoded.
 	+ **geo**: includes a geojson of the crime data that were geocoded in Vancouver. (not all were correctly matched!)
