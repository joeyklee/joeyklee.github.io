		You have to build from source which is not so straightforward if you're not used to using the terminal and/or if you don't know what the Terminal is. I can help set this up for you, but may take some time. You're still welcome to check out the talk and hang out. If you want to set it up yourself:
		 
		NOTE: If npm or homebrew aren't things you have yet on your machine, then you might need those before continuing.

# Abstract
"Let's make an interactive map for the web!" is an introductory hands-on workshop on building your first interactive map for the web. In this workshop, you will learn the basics of Tilemill and Mapbox - two of the most used and user-friendly and opensource tools for building delightful, clickable, zoomable, and custom maps for the web. There will be two sessions followed by an open lab section. We welcome everyone to join the workshop, especially those who are interested in finding new ways to communicate their data/research, meeting other map nerds, or just looking for a tilemill refresher and a friendly environment.

The tutorial will be focused mainly on building a basic interactive web map. There will be limited discussion of mapbox.js/leaflet.js so this workshop may not be as informative for those more advanced mappers out there. Regardless of skill level, I'd be happy to meet you!
