* Personalized News Feed
	* links to blogs, news, videos, photos, and more 
* (Shameless) Self-Promotion
	* share thoughts, personal work, and project updates.
* Connecting with friends and people you haven't met but feel like you know
	* "tag" people in posts to attribute their work 
	* "tag" people to get a reply or an answer to a question
  

### Instagram

## Additional things:

### Markdown:
* Less complicated than html and latex but more features than simple text file
* Makes way for nice documentation --> quick and easy 
* You can even export to html and pdf
* nice ditors like: "[Mou](http://25.io/mou/)"
